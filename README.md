# ParkingValet+
The aim of this project is to develop a database, a data engine, an ETL procedure and a visualization tool for a fictious parking lot management system. A group of R has been written to perrform some basic operations to retrieve data from the database, generates fictious data and feeding, parking and pulling events and also fictious invoices.

The database has been created with Microsoft SQL Server 2019. The scripts in R, the ETL procedure with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (SQL Service Integration Service), the visualization has been developed with PowerBI.
  
The aim of this project is also to develop some applications explicitly for training and personal learning purposes or code reviewing. I do not intend to provide any part of code or script or file for commercial use. I do not own and will not own any responsability for the misuse of the scripts/data/files in this project nor I do own or will own any resposability for the data in it. I do not own or will own any responsability for damages or any other harmful or legally relevant events associated with the misuse of the scripts/file published in this repository.
