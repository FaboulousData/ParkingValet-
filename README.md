# ParkingValet+
The aim of this project is to develop a database, a data engine, an ETL procedure and a visualization tool for a fictious parking lot management system. A set of functions and scripts have been written in R to perform some basic operations on fictious data, to retrieve data from the database in order to create parking and pulling events and also fictious invoices.

The database has been created with Microsoft SQL Server 2019. Some scripts in R have been written to simulate parking data, an ETL procedure has been set up to load data automatically into the database using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (SQL Service Integration Service) and a visualization tool has been used to provide insights and some useful KPIs (currently under revision) with PowerBI.
  
The aim of this project is also to develop some applications explicitly for training and personal learning purposes or code reviewing. I do not intend to provide any part of code or script or file for commercial use. I do not own and will not own any responsability for the misuse of the scripts/data/files in this project nor I do own or will own any resposability for the data in it. I do not own or will own any responsability for damages or any other harmful or legally relevant events associated with the misuse of the scripts/file published in this repository.

I will also provide a quick guide on how to run the scripts.
