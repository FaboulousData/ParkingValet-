# ParkingValet+
The aim of this project is to develop a databse, an ETL procedure and a visualization tool for a fictious parking lot management system.

The database has been created with Microsoft SQL Server 2019. Some scripts in R have been written to simulate parking data, an ETL procedure has been set up to load automatically the data into the database using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (SQL Service Integration Service) and a visualization tool has been used to provide insights and some useful KPIs with PowerBI, using DAX language to perform advanced calculation on attributes and data.
  
The aim of this project is to develop some applications explicitly for training and personal learning purposes or code reviewing. I do not intend to provide any part of code or script or file for commercial use. I do not own and will not own any responsability for the misuse of the scripts/data/files in this project nor I do own or will own any resposability for the data in it.
