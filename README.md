# ParkingValet-
  The aim of this project is to develop a database, a data engine, an ETL and a visualization tool for a fictious parking lot management system. A script written in R peforms some basic operations to retrieve data from the database, generates fictious data feeding, parking and pulling events and fictious invoices. In addition, a SSIS project developed with Visual Studio 2019 has been created in order to define an ETL procedure to load daily fictious data to the database. A PowerBI reporting file has been created to visualize some metrics and facts about the parking system.  The aim of this project is to develop some application for training and personal learning purposes. I do not intend to provide any part of code or script or file for commercial use. I do not own any responsability for the misuse of the scripts/data/files in this project nor I do own any resposability for the data in it.
